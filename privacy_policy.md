Privacy Policy for Betza’s Cleaning Service

Last Updated: 11/21/25

Betza’s Cleaning Service ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our application collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our service.

By using our application, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

1. Information We Collect

To provide our services, we may request access to specific permissions on your Android device.

A. Location Data (Geofencing and Job Management)

Our application collects location data to enable employee job tracking and geofencing capabilities.

Foreground Processing: We use your location to verify when you are at a client site to start or end a job.

Background Processing: If you utilize our geofencing features, Betza’s Cleaning Service collects location data even when the app is closed or not in use to automatically detect arrival and departure times at designated job sites.

We do not use this location data for advertising purposes. It is used strictly for workforce management and job verification.

B. Device Information (Phone State)

We may request the READ_PHONE_STATE permission. We use this permission to:

Handle interruptions (such as incoming phone calls) gracefully while you are using the app.

C. Native Device Integrations

Our app interacts with other applications on your device to streamline your workflow. These interactions are performed using standard Android Intents:

Maps & Navigation: When you choose to navigate to a client's home, our app passes the address to your device's native map application (e.g., Google Maps). We do not track your route once you leave our application.

Phone Dialer: When you tap to call a client, our app opens your device's native dialer with the number pre-filled. We do not record calls or access your call logs.

SMS/Text Messaging: When you send an appointment reminder, our app opens your device's native SMS application with a pre-filled message. You must manually press "Send." We do not read your text messages or send messages without your direct interaction.

2. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected data for the following purposes:

To verify employee attendance and location for job assignments.

To facilitate communication between employees and clients.

To provide and maintain the functionality of the Service.

3. Data Retention and Deletion

We retain location and job data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy (such as payroll verification or service history). If you wish to request the deletion of your data, please contact your administrator.

4. Security

We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
